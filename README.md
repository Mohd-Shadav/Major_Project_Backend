# Major Project Backend

This repository contains the backend code for the Major Project. The backend is developed using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB/MySQL** (depending on the actual database you're using). It powers key features of the project, providing RESTful APIs, database interaction, and authentication.

## Features
- User Authentication and Authorization (e.g., Admin, Customer)
- Database Management for project entities
- RESTful API services for frontend integration
- Error Handling and Middleware for enhanced security

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment
- **Express.js**: Backend web framework
- **MongoDB/MySQL**: Database for data persistence
- **JWT**: Token-based authentication
- **Mongoose/Sequelize**: ORM for database interaction (depending on your database)

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine
- MongoDB or MySQL server running (update the connection string accordingly)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aryan88111/Major_Project_Backend.git
   cd Major_Project_Backend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root folder and configure the following variables:
   ```
   PORT=5000
   DB_URI=your_database_uri_here
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
   ```

4. Run the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. The server will start running at `http://localhost:5000`.

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- **POST** `/api/auth/register` - Register a new user
- **POST** `/api/auth/login` - Log in an existing user

### User Management
- **GET** `/api/users` - Get a list of all users
- **DELETE** `/api/users/:id` - Delete a user by ID

### Additional Endpoints
Depending on your project's specific functionality, include details on APIs related to your business logic.
